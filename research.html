                <p>In the study, we analyzed into the serum proteome of COVID-19 patients up to twelve months post-infection, revealing persistent complement system activation and thromboinflammation. We discovered that terminal complement complex formation was altered, with an increased presence of the C5bC6 complex and a decrease in C7 incorporation, which is essential for cell membrane integration. A prominent thromboinflammatory response, marked by elevated von Willebrand factor and diminished antithrombin III levels, was also linked to the clinical persistence of Long Covid symptoms.</p>
                <p>Importantly, this research employed machine learning techniques to analyze the vast dataset of over 6500 protein expressiong levels, enabling the identification of key biomarkers and mechanistic insights into Long Covid. The use of machine learning not only enhanced the precision of the biomarker identification process but also allowed for the quantification of complex interrelations between different proteins and pathways involved in the disease process. This approach provided a robust basis for the development of targeted diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing the ongoing immune and coagulation abnormalities associated with Long Covid. The integration of advanced computational tools like machine learning thus significantly contributed to our understanding of Long Covid’s underlying biological mechanisms and offered promising directions for future research and treatment strategies.</p>
